# Toko Komputer (Computer Store)

My second-year final project for study case Computer Store. This one is the dashboard for the customer role. Back in that day, I didn't really understand how to use user access concept or something similar. So, I just build two same projects for different roles. 

PS: There is a missing repository for the backend part. So this dashboard can't work anymore. 

## Deployment

Package manager already updated using pnpm. First install the dependencies using the command.

```bash
  pnpm install
```

Now you can run this with command

```bash
  pnpm start
```

PS: Watch out! There is nodemon in this programme
